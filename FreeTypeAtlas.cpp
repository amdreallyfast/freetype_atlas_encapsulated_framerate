    // A texture atlas means that a bunch of different images are loaded into the same texture.  
    // In many applications, such as games with sprites, the textures are all the same size, so 
    // it is rather easy to make a perfect grid.  TrueType fonts are not so pretty for nice 
    // grids, but when rendered properly they look very nice, so I'm willing to jump through 
    // some hoops when loading them.  The characters in TrueType fonts are not the same size 
    // because each character is designed individually and has its own dimensions.  To load 
    // these into an atlas, I am going to run through all the characters and calculate how much 
    // space will be required to load them side-by-side, but be aware that this row of 
    // characters will be of uneven height (not all characters are the same height) and may run 
    // up against the maximum byte width of a texture.  Then I'll allocate the bytes necessary 
    // for a texture to hold all the character's glyphs, and finally I'll load them all 
    // side-by-side in the same order as when I calculated the required texture size.

    // The GL standard defines a maximum size (in bytes) for textures.  This affects 1D and 2D 
    // textures (I've been told that 3D textures have their own max values).  1D is just a line, 
    // so it only applies to that one dimension.  For 2D textures, the max size applies to both 
    // width and height.  This value is determined by the graphics API.  I checked this program
    // (on 3-29-2016), and at this time OpenGL is telling me that my max texture size is 16384 
    // bytes.  This means that I have 16384 bytes for width and 16384 bytes for height, and I 
    // doubt that I am going to max out either with this FreeType library, although if font size (??font size -> bitmap size??)
    // became enormous I might need to start a second row.  But while the GL standard does not 
    // tell the graphics API an upper limit, it does tell them a lower limit for this max value, 
    // which I believe is 1024 bytes.  That is, OpenGL is free to specify that a maximum texture 
    // size is 16kb, or 32kb, or whatever, but the max texture size must not be below 1024 
    // bytes, which should be sufficient to support rather old video or just incapable video 
    // hardware.  A max size of 1024 bytes means that a 2D texture can 1024x1024 bytes, or 
    // 1024x512 bytes, or 2x1024 (yes, 2 bytes), and it would be okay.  

    // for FreeType fonts under default rendering, 1 pixel == 1 byte
    // Note: FreeType 2 (the header indicates that I am using 2.6.1 as of 3-29-2016) does not 
    // provide RGB data for a texture, but it does provide monochrome (1-bit) or 8-bit greyscale 
    // bitmaps.  
    // http://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/ft2faq.html#general-donts

    // to be loaded from the TrueType file into a small bitmap in the default render mode.  
    // http://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-base_interface.html#FT_LOAD_RENDER

    // alpha blending and gamma correction to correctly render non-monochrome glyph bitmaps onto

    // 4 of them.
    // Also Note: Due to the way that fonts work in texture atlases, only one character is 
    // drawn at a time, which means that only 1 quad is drawn at a time.  Rather than set up 
    // indexes and perform an element draw, just use a GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP.  That works great 
    // for a single (and only a single) quad, hence the hard-coded vertex count (4) in the 
    // draw call.  If it were not a quad, instancing and glDrawElements(...) should be used
    // instead.
